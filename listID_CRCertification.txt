Finding the Id (Guid) for a SharePoint List
with 36 comments

There are times when you need to find the Id (a Guid) of a list – for example, when setting the Task list to be used with SharePoint Designer Workflows (see my blog post here). Here’s a simple way of doing this:

Navigate to the SharePoint list using the browser.
Select the Settings + List Settings menu command.
Copy the Url from the browser address bar into Notepad. It will look something like:
http://moss2007/ProjectX/_layouts/listedit.aspx?List=%7B26534EF9%2DAB3A%2D46E0%2DAE56%2DEFF168BE562F%7D

Delete everying before and including “List=”.
Change “%7B” to “{”
Change all “%2D” to “-“
Chnage “%7D” to “}”
You are now left with the Id:

{26534EF9-AB3A-46E0-AE56-EFF168BE562F}
